\subsection{Description}

 This constant is defined with a value of -1, which because size\textunderscore t is an unsigned integral type, it is the largest possible representable value for this type. The class template acts as a wrapper to the underlying container - only a specific set of functions is provided. 
 The queue pushes the elements on the back of the underlying container and pops them from the front.
\subsection{Bug Notes}
 There are no reported bugs. I mean come on. There has to be a bug somewhere! I think I like to watch the stars.
